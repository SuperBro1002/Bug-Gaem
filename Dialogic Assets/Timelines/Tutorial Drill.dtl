Bark, stone, water, and sparks shoot into the air!
Stunned by the shaking, deafened by the sound, Zephyr and Triss can only watch as a giant Robug drill carves a path through the fountain and further beyond.
Triss (Hurt): H-how??

Atlas (Angry): Robugs?! We're under attack!
Atlas (Neutral): Auri, get out here!
join Auri (Auri) 2
Auri (Auri): What's happening, ma'am??
Atlas (Neutral): Auri, I need you to bring the rest of the 100th here. Then head towards the main army and use your firefly signal to call for reinforcements.
Auri (Auri): You got it, ma'am.
Atlas (Proud): We'll handle the rest.
leave Auri [animation="Slide Out Right" length="1"]
Atlas (Neutral): Zephyr, give us your orders!
